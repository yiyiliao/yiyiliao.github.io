I am an assistant professor in [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University). Before that, I was a Postdoc in [Autonomous Vision Group](http://cvlibs.net/), a part of the University of Tübingen and the MPI for Intelligent Systems, working with [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://avg.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/ageiger). I received my Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University) in June 2018 and the B.S. degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Jiaotong_University) in 2013.

My research interest lies in 3D computer vision, including 3D scene understanding, 3D reconstruction, depth estimation and 3D controllable image synthesis.

For prospective students interested in computer vision, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:yiyi.liao@zju.edu.cn)!
