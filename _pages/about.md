I am an assistant professor in [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University), leading the [X-Dimensional Representations Lab (X-D Lab)](https://yiyiliao.github.io/xdlab). Before that, I was a Postdoc in [Autonomous Vision Group](http://cvlibs.net/) at the University of Tübingen and the MPI for Intelligent Systems, working with [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://avg.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/ageiger). I received my Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University) in June 2018 and the B.S. degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Jiaotong_University) in 2013.

My research interest lies in 3D computer vision, including scene understanding, 3D reconstruction and 3D generative models.

For prospective students interested in computer vision, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:yiyi.liao@zju.edu.cn)!
